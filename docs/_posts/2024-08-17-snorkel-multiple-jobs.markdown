The Courts of Accounts in Brazil have, among their constitutional duties, the responsibility to oversee personnel expenses of the entities they audit. For this purpose, the Courts of Accounts receive information from the audited entities regarding their staff and payroll. One of the criteria examined in audits of personnel expenses is the legality of cases where public servants hold multiple positions in different agencies. Article 37 of the Brazilian Federal Constitution prohibits the accumulation of public offices except in cases of: two teaching positions; one teaching position with another technical or scientific position; or when both positions are exclusive to regulated health professionals.
